Abstract
Accurate modeling of bacterial biofilm growth is essential for understanding their
complex dynamics in biomedical, environmental, and industrial settings. These
dynamics are shaped by a variety of environmental influences, including the
presence of antibiotics, nutrient availability, and inter-species interactions, all of
# 1 which affect species-specific growth rates. However, capturing this behavior in
computational models is challenging due to the presence of hybrid uncertainties,
a combination of epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete knowledge
about model parameters) and aleatory uncertainty (reflecting inherent biological
variability and stochastic environmental conditions). In this work, we present a
Bayesian model updating (BMU) framework to calibrate a recently introduced
multi-species biofilm growth model. To enable efficient inference in the presence
of hybrid uncertainties, we construct a reduced-order model (ROM) derived using
the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) approach. TSM allows for an
efficient propagation of aleatory uncertainty, which enables single-loop Bayesian
inference, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive nested (double-loop)
schemes typically required in hybrid uncertainty quantification. The BMU frame-
work employs a likelihood function constructed from the mean and variance
of stochastic model outputs, enabling robust parameter calibration even under
sparse and noisy data. We validate our approach through two case studies: a
two-species and a four-species biofilm model. Both demonstrate that our method
not only accurately recovers the underlying model parameters but also provides
predictive responses consistent with the synthetic data.

# 1 Introduction
Bacterial biofilms are structured microbial communities whose growth dynamics are
influenced by environmental conditions, nutrient availability, antibiotics, and inter-
species interactions [1]. A key feature of biofilms is their remarkable resilience: they
can exhibit up to 1000-fold greater tolerance to antibiotics and environmental stressors
compared to planktonic (free-floating) bacteria [2]. This inherent robustness con-
tributes to the widespread presence of biofilms across diverse settings, such as natural
ecosystems, industrial systems, and clinical environments. In industrial and environ-
mental contexts, biofilms can play beneficial roles, such as in wastewater treatment
processes [3]. However, they are also associated with numerous challenges, including
persistent infections [4, 5], medical device contamination [6], and infrastructure bio-
fouling [7]. One particularly important area is oral biofilm formation, which can lead
to infections around dental implants [8–11].
In many environments, biofilms are composed of multiple microbial species that
compete for resources and respond collectively to external cues [12–14]. Understanding
the dynamics of such multispecies biofilms and modeling these systems is critical
for any application. Some fundamental interaction principles are outlined by James
et al. [15] and they serve as a theoretical foundation of how the species interact, and
also how they do not interact in some scenarios. Depending on the specific area of
application, different aspects are modeled and different parameters are used to describe
the physical and chemical processes of the biofilm growth. Ouidir et al. [16] review
different approaches for the modeling of such systems and classify them by application
# 2 to wastewaster treatment, soil, and biomedical applications. Specifically, they focus on
biofilms in the oral cavity which is important for dental applications, also highlighted
in [14, 17].
A recently proposed continuum model by Klempt et al. [18], derived from the
extended Hamilton principle, captures multi-species biofilm growth by introduc-
ing abstract material parameters. However, these parameters are typically unknown
and subject to uncertainty. Combined with the inherent stochasticity of biological
processes, this presents a significant challenge for constructing predictive and phys-
ically meaningful models. Accurate parameter inference is thus essential to identify
underlying biofilm properties from data and enable robust modeling.
Various strategies for calibrating biological models have been proposed. Frequen-
tist approaches, such as those reviewed by Read et al. [19], rely on statistical tests
(e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov) to compare model output distributions with data. Other
works follow similar strategies [20–23]. In contrast, Bayesian inference provides a prob-
abilistic framework for parameter estimation that naturally incorporates uncertainty
[24, 25]. While Bayesian methods offer interpretability and flexibility, their computa-
tional cost remains a key limitation. Recent developments, including modern Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), sequential Monte Carlo, and Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC), have helped mitigate this burden [24].
Despite their advantages, parameter calibration is often neglected in biofilm model-
ing. For example, Shewa et al. [23] and Rittmann et al. [26] note that default literature
values are frequently used instead of performing parameter calibration. Recent stud-
ies have demonstrated the value of Bayesian inference for biofilm models, including
parameter estimation with quorum sensing [27] and the inference of rheological prop-
erties from experimental data [28]. In the field of computational mechanics, Willmann
et al. [29] propose a Bayesian framework for the calibration of a model of multi-physics
bioflm model introduced in Ref. [30]. The authors present an approach that can also
handle unavoidable uncertainty and reduces the computational cost through the use
of a Gaussian process surrogate for the log-likelihood. Further, different discrepancy
metrics are introduced and compared in their study.
The problem to estimate parameters under uncertainty with limited experimen-
tal data is also present in many other fields of applications. One such application
is the estimation of parameters of constitutive models in computational mechanics.
Wollner et al. [31] present a Bayesian inference framework which they apply to the
parameter estimation of the hyperelastic Ogden model. A summary of approaches
common in applications in mechanical and civil engineering are given in in Ref. [32].
There, again, we come back to Bayesian inference which allows for the handling of
the unknown parameters through a posterior probability distribution of said param-
eters conditioned on the observed data. In engineering applications this is commonly
referred to as Bayesian model updating (BMU) and related to the contribution of Beck
and Katafygiotis [33].
Building on recent advancements in BMU for engineering applications, we extend
these methods to the biofilm growth model introduced by Klempt et al. [18]. In such
systems, it is essential to account for inherent variability caused by biological ran-
domness and stochastic environmental influences. This intrinsic variability introduces
# 3 aleatory uncertainty, which significantly increases the complexity of stochastic model
updating. For robust and reliable inference, it is crucial to represent both epistemic
(due to limited knowledge) and aleatory (inherent randomness) uncertainties, collec-
tively referred to as hybrid uncertainty [34, 35]. However, hybrid uncertainty poses
major computational challenges in Bayesian inference, where propagating stochastic
variability through complex models typically requires expensive double-loop proce-
dures [32, 36, 37]. To address this, we employ a reduced-order model (ROM) based on
the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) methodology [38, 39]. TSM approx-
imates the stochastic dynamics by expanding the model response with respect to the
uncertain parameters around their expected values and solving a sequence of determin-
istic evolution equations for the expansion coefficients. This separation of temporal and
stochastic components enables efficient forward simulation under aleatory uncertainty,
eliminating the need for repeated sampling in time.
The aim of this work is to calibrate a continuum model of biofilm growth, influenced
by nutrients and antibiotics, as introduced in [18]. We employ a Bayesian updating
approach to infer key model parameters under hybrid uncertainties. We model our
unknown parameters as parametric probability-boxes (p-boxes) with unknown mean
values and fixed coefficients of variations, in order to model natural variability as
aleatory uncertainty. Then, a TSM-ROM is derived for an efficient propagation of
the aleatory uncertainties as to not use a double-loop of full-order model calls. We
construct a likelihood function based on summary statistics, i.e., mean and variance,
of model responses.
In this paper, we begin with a review of the theoretical background on Bayesian
model updating, the treatment of hybrid uncertainties and TSM in section 2. Subse-
quently, in section 3, we present the application of TSM-ROM to the biofilm model.
Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology through two case studies,
illustrating its accuracy and computational efficiency in section 4. Our results high-
light the potential for broader applications in uncertainty-aware modeling of biological
systems.
# 2 Background
2.1 Bayesian model updating
Stochastic model updating aims to refine a forward model M(θ) by inferring unknown
parameters θbased on observed data [40]. Here, θis a realization of the M-dimensional
random variable Θ, defined over a parameter space DΘ⊂RM. The forward model thus
defines a mapping from the parameter space to the output space M:DΘ→RNout.
To relate the model predictions y=M(θ) to the observed data D, a discrepancy
termεis introduced:
D=M(θ) +ε. (1)
This term accounts for measurement noise and model inaccuracies, acknowledging
that computational models are idealized approximations of reality [40]. A common
assumption is that εfollows a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with covariance Σε,
i.e.,ε∼ N(0,Σε).
# 4 The Bayesian model updating (BMU) approach [33] addresses challenges such as
incomplete data, observation noise, and model-form uncertainty by treating the param-
etersθas random variables. Prior knowledge about these parameters is encoded in a
prior distribution p(θ).
A central component of Bayesian inference is the likelihood function L(θ) =
p(D|θ), which quantifies the probability of observing the data Dfor a given parameter
realization θ. Essentially, the likelihood serves as a stochastic measure of fit between
model predictions and observations. Its specific form depends on modeling assump-
tions for the discrepancy term. Under the Gaussian noise assumption, the likelihood is
itself a Gaussian distribution centered at the model output and evaluated at the data
[33, 40]. Its value increases as the data and model assumptions align more closely.
Bayes’ theorem then combines the prior and likelihood to yield the posterior
distribution p(θ|D) over the parameters:
p(θ|D) =L(θ)p(θ)
p(D), (2)
where p(D) =R
L(θ)p(θ) dθis the model evidence. Since this normalizing constant is
independent of a fixed set of observations Dand often intractable, the unnormalized
posterior is typically used in practice:
p(θ|D)∝ L(θ)p(θ). (3)
Note that in eq. (2) and eq. (3) the densities are implicitly also conditioned on the
model assumptions.
2.1.1 Bayesian model updating in the presence of hybrid
uncertainties
The previously introduced Bayesian model updating approach treats unknown param-
eters as random variables with prior distributions that are refined into posterior
distributions using observational data. This process only reduces epistemic uncer-
tainty, assuming that all variability can be captured probabilistically. However, many
real-world systems exhibit not only epistemic but also aleatory uncertainty: inher-
ent randomness that cannot be reduced through further data collection. While
epistemic uncertainty refers to fixed-but-unknown quantities, aleatory uncertainty
reflects stochastic variation between experimental or simulation outcomes, even under
identical conditions.
A comprehensive review of model updating under different uncertainty types is
provided in [32], where parameters are categorized into four types based on the pres-
ence and combination of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. An overview of these
categories is illustrated in fig. 1.
In this work, we focus on the specific challenges posed by parameters of cate-
gory IV, which involve both types of uncertainty and are thus described by imprecise
probabilities [35]. A common representation of such parameters is the probability box
5
(p-box), in which aleatory uncertainty is modeled as a random variable, while epistemic
uncertainty is expressed as interval bounds on the distribution parameters.
In these cases, model outputs are inherently stochastic. A deterministic mapping
like in eq. (1) is no longer sufficient, and commonly a stochastic forward model based on
Monte Carlo simulation ˆM:DΘ→RNout×Nsamples is defined, where Nsamples denotes
the number of Monte Carlo samples used to propagate aleatory uncertainty for each
parameter configuration θ. Each input returns a sequence of outputs:
Y=
y1,y2, . . . ,yNsamples	
=ˆM(θ). (4)
This setup typically results in a nested (double-loop) approach: an outer loop explores
different realizations of θ, while the inner loop samples the stochastic model output
using the deterministic model M. Examples for this are the updating approaches in
Refs. [32, 36, 37]. Although this allows the construction of p-boxes for the model
response, it comes at a high computational cost, particularly in Bayesian inverse
problems, which require many model evaluations across the parameter space.

In the presence of hybrid uncertainties, constructing the likelihood function
becomes especially challenging, since model outputs are no longer deterministic but
represent probability distributions. In Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), for
example, model predictions are compared with observations using distance metrics to
approximate a likelihood function [32, 41, 42]. Alternatively, summary statistics such
as the mean and variance can be used to define the likelihood function.

2.1.2 Formulation of the likelihood function
Given the deterministic model in eq. (1) and a corresponding observation D, and
assuming Gaussian-distributed measurement noise, the likelihood function can be
written as:
L(θ) =1p
(2π)NoutdetΣεexp
−1
2(D−y)⊤Σ−1
ε(D−y)
. (5)
Note that eq. (5) is relating a single multi-variate observation Dto a single deter-
ministic model output y, where Σεdescribes the expected spread due to the additive
errors. This can be extended to the stochastic model ˆMby using for example the
predicted mean µYand covariance ΣYof the stochastic predictions in eq. (4):
L(θ) =1p
(2π)NoutdetΣYexp
−1
2(D−µY)⊤Σ−1
Y(D−µY)
. (6)
Since the likelihood typically has limited support within the parameter space DΘ, it
is convenient to consider its logarithmic form to improve numerical stability:
logL(θ) =−logq
(2π)NoutdetΣY
−1
2(D−µY)⊤Σ−1
Y(D−µY). (7)
This formulation extends naturally to multiple uncorrelated observations Dk,k∈
{1, . . . , m }, by summing the log-likelihoods:
logL(θ) =X
k−logq
(2π)NoutdetΣk
Y
−1
2(Dk−µk
Y)⊤Σk
Y,k−1(Dk−µk
Y).(8)
Here, the measurements Dkcan correspond to either repeated observations of the same
quantity or, as in this paper, values taken at different time steps. The quantities µk
Y
andΣk
Ythus denote the model-predicted mean and covariance at each measurement
time step tk. Note that in stochastic forward models, where Monte Carlo sampling
is used, eq. (8) would need the mentioned double-loop approach, as estimating the
means and covariances requires multiple samples. For this reason, we will implement
a TSM-ROM to facilitate faster parameter inference. Details on the exact setup of the
likelihood will be given in section 4.
2.1.3 Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo
In practice, the posterior distribution is analytically intractable, primarily due to its
implicit dependence on the forward model through the likelihood function [40]. More-
over, when multiple measurements are incorporated, the posterior typically does not
conform to any standard probability distribution, which becomes clear when consider-
ing how the log-likelihood function is constructed in eq. (8). To address this, Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are widely used, as they enable sampling from
# 7 distributions of arbitrary shape. A key advantage of MCMC techniques is their abil-
ity to draw samples directly from the unnormalized posterior distribution, as given in
eq. (3).
The most common MCMC algorithm is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [43,
44] which generates samples from the unnormalized posterior by starting a random
walk algorithm with Markov chains form some initial samples and than accepting or
rejecting new samples based on a proposal distribution.
In this paper, we apply the Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC)
algorithm [45] to draw samples from eq. (3). TMCMC is an advanced MCMC method
designed to sample from multimodal distributions by sampling from a sequence of
intermediate distributions rather than from the posterior directly, a process which is
also known as annealing [46]. These transitional densities are defined as:
pj(θ)∝ L(θ)βjp(θ) (9)
where j∈ {1,2, . . . , m }represents the transition steps, with the corresponding tem-
pering parameter βjprogressing from β0= 0 to βm= 1 through intermediate values
β0= 0< β 1< β 2<···βm= 1. This gradual transition allows the prior density
p(θ) to smoothly evolve into the posterior density L(θ)p(θ), as noted in Ref. [40]. To
make use of the formulation of the log-likelihood in eq. (8), the transitional densities
in eq. (9) are also formulated in a logarithmic expression. We chose TMCMC for its
robustness against posteriors with small support due to the annealing procedure.
2.2 Time-separated Stochastic Mechanics
In order to reduce the high computational cost of the double-loop approach, a sur-
rogate model or ROM can be used to replace the inner loop and thus decrease the
computational cost, as also mentioned in [32]. Faes et al. [47] discuss different surrogate
modeling techniques for the propagation of hybrid uncertainties modeled with p-boxes.
Further, Reiser et al. [48] present a two-step Bayesian framework for surrogate-based
inference that propagates both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties from surrogate
model training to parameter inference.
Here, we use the Time-separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) [38, 39] to efficiently
handle the intrinsic aleatory uncertainty and reduce the updating from a double to
a single-loop algorithm. The main idea of the TSM is to replace a forward model
M(θ) with the parameters θby a surrogate MS. The surrogate is defined such, that
the first ppartial derivatives of the surrogate coincide with the forward model at the
expectation of the parameters. For a scalar parameter θwith expectation ⟨θ⟩this
reads as
∂i
∂θiM
⟨θ⟩=∂i
∂θiMS
⟨θ⟩∀i∈ {0, . . . , p }. (10)
For an algebraic model, this coincides with a Taylor series. Forward models involv-
ing derivatives in time need a special treatment. This is presented in more detail
in Section 3.2. The approach is advantageous for the application to Bayesian Model
Updating as the approximation is best near to the expectation of the parameters.
# 8 Often, much of the probability mass is indeed collected around the expectation. In com-
parison to other surrogate models, as the Polynomial Chaos Expansion and Stochastic
Collocation Method, only a very limited number of function evaluations needed. In
fact, for many problems a linear or quadratic approximation suffices.
# 3 Application to biofilm growth
In this paper, we apply Bayesian model updating to identify parameters in the evo-
lution of biofilm growth of a model introduced by Klempt et al. [18]. This model
incorporates the growth of multiple species under the influence of nutrients and antibi-
otics, as well as their interactions. The growth is represented by the concentration of
the biofilms over time, denoted by ϕ. Additionally, ψis defined as the percentage of
living bacteria. The volume occupied by living bacteria from species lis expressed as
ϕl=ϕlψl. The model derives from the extended Hamilton principle [49], which leads
for the special case of a local, quasi-static, isothermal model with no external forces to
∂Ψ

the energy density function Ψ, the dissipation function ∆sand the constraint function
c.
The temporal evolution of biofilm concentration is determined by the energy den-
sity function and the dissipation function. The energy density function is defined
as
Ψ =−1
2c∗ϕ·A·ϕ+1
2α∗ψ·B·ψ (13)
and consists of two terms. The first term, where c∗represents nutrients, which promote
an increase in living bacteria, while the second term, where α∗signifies antibiotics,
results in a decrease.
Coefficient matrices AandBare crucial in characterizing the material behavior of
the species. The matrix Ais a symmetric matrix designed to capture the interactions
between different biofilm species and the effects of nutrients on their growth. Its off-
diagonal elements represent inter-species interactions, while the diagonal elements
account for the effects of nutrients on individual species growth. Generally, Acan be
expressed for multiple species as
A=

# 9 The matrix Bis a diagonal matrix that characterizes the impact of antibiotics on
the viability of the biofilm species. Its diagonal components represent the susceptibility
of each species to antibiotics. The general form of Bfor multiple species is assumed
to be
B=

. (15)
The dissipation function is modeled as a function of˙¯ϕand ˙ϕ:
∆s= ∆s(˙¯ϕ,˙ϕ) =1

with the diagonal viscosity matrix
η=
η10···0

. (17)
The choice of modeling the dissipation as a function of the rate of living bacteria˙¯ϕ
and not directly of the rate of the state variables ˙ϕand ˙ψleads to a deeply linked
system of equation, resulting in complex model behavior.
To limited the growth to a finite amount, the total volume of all species is limited
by the constraint function
c=γ nX
l=0ϕl−1!

with the Lagrange multiplicator γ. This leads to the governing evolution equations in
their strong forms:

In the following, the parameters in AandB, which describe the behavior of the
species are referred to as the unknown, stochastic parameters θ. The observations D
are the volume percentage for each species ϕland the percentage of living cells for
each species ψlfor each time step.
# 10 To ensure, that the internal variables remained in the interval ξi∈[0,1], the penalty
method was applied. The penalty terms Kp(1
ξ2
1(1−ξ1)2) were added for all internal
variables to the free energy density in Equation 13.
3.1 Uncertainty model for biofilm growth
For the uncertainty model involved in the parameter modeling of the biofilm growth,
we treat these parameters θas category IV, specifically using p-boxes. This complex
setup with mixed uncertainties is designed to replicate the uncertainties in real-world
biofilm growth due to both inherent randomness (aleatory uncertainty) and data
scarcity (epistemic uncertainty). The hybrid nature of these uncertainties justifies the
application of a ROM using TSM to more efficiently handle both types of uncertainties
in inverse problems.
Based on this reasoning, the biofilm growth model is implemented in a stochastic
manner, as shown in eq. (4). The TSM-ROM replaces the Monte Carlo simulation ˆM
and returns a sequence of outputs for a given input θ. The sequence of outputs at a
given time instance is stochastic due to the aleatoric uncertainty inherent to biofilm
growth. This is true even if the epistemic uncertainty is reduced to zero. The epistemic
uncertainty is connected to the mean value of θ, whose exact distribution is unknown
a priori and is inferred via Bayesian updating.
3.2 TSM-ROM for biofilm growth
Equations (19), (20) and (21) constitute a nonlinear system of equations for the evolu-
tion of the variables ψandϕ. The input parameter θis split into an part with epistemic
uncertainty θ(0)and a part with aleatoric uncertainties ˜θwith the expectation ⟨˜θ⟩=0.
In the following, the input parameters are referred to as θTSM=θ(0)+˜θ. The variables
ψandϕare expressed by a linear Taylor series in the aleatoric uncertainties
ψTSM=ψ(0)+˜θ·ψ(1)(22)
ϕTSM=ϕ(0)+˜θ·ϕ(1). (23)
The Taylor series for the variables ψandϕconstitute the surrogate model MS. No
solution of the systems of equations is needed for a new parameter value θ. While a
higher order model is simple to implement, a linear series already often suffices [39]. For
simplicity, let us refer to the system of equations (19) to (21) as G(˙ϕ,˙ψ,ϕ,ψ,θTSM).
The system of equations naturally depends on both, the variables themselves and their
time derivatives. The time derivative of the Taylor series results trivially as
˙ψTSM=˙ψ(0)+˜θ·˙ψ(1)(24)
˙ϕTSM=˙ϕ(0)+˜θ·˙ϕ(1). (25)
because the random term ˜θis time-independent. All Taylor series are set into the
system of equations. The zeroth order terms can be calculated as
G(˙ϕTSM,˙ψTSM,ϕTSM,ψTSM,θTSM)˜θ=0. (26)
# 11 Unsurprisingly, the original system of equations evaluated at θTSM=0results. For
the derivation of the first order term,
d
d˜θG(˙ϕTSM,˙ψTSM,ϕTSM,ψTSM,θTSM)˜θ=0. (27)
is calculated. This results in a nonlinear system of equations that allow to compute ˙ϕ(1)
and ˙ψ(1). As these equations depend on ˙ϕ(0)and ˙ψ(0), a staggered solution scheme
naturally arises.
The model and its updating procedure are implemented in the open-source pro-
gramming language Julia. Performance tests for a single deterministic model prediction
and for the TSM-ROM implementation indicate that one model run with two species
requires approximately 3 ms, whereas solving the complete TSM-ROM takes about 40
ms on the same hardware. It should be noted that, to fully represent aleatory uncer-
tainties, MC simulations require multiple, often hundreds of model runs. In contrast,
the TSM-ROM computes stochastic moments directly, making it considerably more
efficient for mixed-uncertainty models and well-suited for multi-query applications.
# 4 Numerical Experiments
To illustrate the application of BMU in determining the material properties governing
biofilm growth, we present two case studies. The primary objective in both cases is to
infer the matrices AandB, which characterize biofilm evolution through the energy
density function outlined in eq. (13).
The first case study involves a model with two species and five unknown material
parameters. The second case study extends this framework to four species with 14
parameters. In both scenarios, the BMU approach utilizes TMCMC, implemented via
the Julia package UncertaintyQuantification.jl [50]. To compare model predictions with
experimental data, we employ the likelihood function given in eq. (8), assessing dis-
crepancies in the volume fractions of living bacteria, denoted by Φ, at predetermined
discrete time steps.
To build the likelihood function, the response of the TSM biofilm model is com-
pared to experimental data. Specifically, we consider the mean response feature of the
l-th species at the k-th time step, denoted as µk
y,l. Similarly, its variance is denoted as
σk
y,l. In this context, the output features are defined as the volume fractions of nliving
bacterial species at various discrete time steps k. For a single sample θj, i.e. one full
simulation of the TSM-ROM model, these features are structured in a matrix form:
yj=
ϕ1
1ϕ2
1···ϕm
1
ϕ1
2ϕ2
2···ϕm
2
............
ϕ1
nϕ2
n···ϕm
n
, (28)
where ϕk
ldenotes the volume fraction of species lat time step k. Here, nrepresents
the total number of species, while mis the number of selected discrete time steps used
# 12 for comparison with observational data. For better readability, we omitted the index
jinϕk
l.
It is important to note that m≪N, where Ndenotes the total number of time
steps in the complete analysis. Typically, a large number of steps such as N= 1000
is used when performing the time integration of the TSM model. This is chosen to
ensure numerical stability and accuracy, as a smaller time step size ∆ thelps to control
numerical errors during the calculation.
While Nallows for detailed modeling of the biofilm dynamics over time, mis
strategically chosen to facilitate the construction of the likelihood function by pro-
viding a manageable subset of time steps. For instance, one might select m= 20
time steps for comparing simulation responses with experimental data. This selection
ensures efficient and meaningful statistical inference without overwhelming computa-
tional resources. Thus, a dataset Dis constructed from Ndata=munique experiments,
each representing a realization that terminates at different time steps. Our aim is to
replicate the setup of in vitro experiments in our in silico experiments, i.e., simu-
lating multiple experiments started from the same initial conditions, but stopped at
different time instances. This approach accounts for both aleatory uncertainty, arising
from inherent randomness in biofilm growth, and epistemic uncertainty due to limited
observational data.
Finally, the likelihood function from eq. (8) is computed for each row within the
feature matrix detailed in eq. (28), as described above. In preliminary testing we found
that using the full covariance matrix is unnecessary, as correlations between the model
outputs are implicitly handled by the model. Therefore, the likelihood is reduced to
only the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix, and the expression in eq. (7)
can be simplified. The full likelihood, constructed from the l∈ {1, . . . , n }species and

4.1 Case I: Two-Species Biofilm Model
In this first case study, we focus on biofilm growth comprising n= 2 interacting species.
Specifically, this case aligns with case 5 in Ref. [18], augmented by the addition of an
interaction parameter a12to adeptly capture inter-species interactions.
For the two-species scenario, the material behavior of the biofilm is characterized
by the two matrices in eqs. (14) and (15) with n= 2. The symmetry inherent in
matrix Areduces the dimensionality of the problem to five independent parameters
θ= [a11, a12, a22, b1, b2]. Each of the five parameters is modeled as a parametric p-
box with a Normal distribution with an unknown mean and a coefficient of variation
of 0.5%.
The dataset Dcomprises Ndata= 20 individual simulations, each concluding at
different time steps, as shown in fig. 2. These data points correspond to model outputs
generated from 20 parameter samples θ, randomly selected from a larger set of 1000
# 13 samples drawn from the Normal distributions of the respective parameters with true
means.
The solid lines represent the time evolution of the 20 samples of volume fractions
of living bacteria for both species, ¯ϕ1and¯ϕ2. The scatters present the 20 randomly
selected realizations at m= 20 evenly spaced time steps within the interval t∈
[0, N= 1000]. Since the initial conditions at t= 0 are known, the first time step is
chosen at t= 50, as depicted in fig. 2. It is important to highlight that the dataset D
only consist of the 20 discrete data points. Further, we note that the time steps were
chosen as a balance between accuracy by using a large number of time instances to
compare the data and realism by using as little data as possible.
The different constant simulation parameters used in case I, e.g., the viscosity
η, different initial conditions, nutrients and antibiotics, are summarized in table 1.
Further, for all the following cases, we use a penalty term Kp= 10−4and initial
ψi= 0.999 for all species. Similarly, table 2 shows the chosen prior distributions of the
mean values of the five parameters that are inferred with the proposed BMU approach.
Here, uninformative priors modeled by uniform distributions are chosen.
Fig. 2 : Dataset with Ndata= 20 volume fractions of living bacteria for two species,
ϕ1(t) and ϕ2(t). Individual realizations are shown as yellow and blue lines, each ending
at different steps, indicated by the dots. The data is generated from 1000 samples of
the underlying true distribution of parameters with mean values θ∗= [1,0.1,1,1,2]
along with a CoV of 0 .5%.
The Bayesian model updating with the described procedure is performed to cali-
brate the model parameters. The resulting samples of the posterior are visualized in
fig. 3. We observe that the posterior bounds are much tighter compared to the pri-
ors, indicating a significant reduction in uncertainty due to the incorporation of data.
The posterior distributions generally peak around the “true” parameter values used

to construct the dataset, while still capturing some spread that reflects the inher-
ent variability in the data. Specifically, the dataset was generated using mean values
θ∗= [1,0.1,1,1,2] along with a CoV of 0 .5%, and the results demonstrate that our
Bayesian updating framework is capable of accurately resolving these values. More-
over, dependencies between parameters become apparent, both in the scatter plots
and in the Pearson correlation coefficients ρcalculated from the posterior samples. For
instance, we observe strong linear correlations between a12andb1(ρ= 0.934), as well
as between a12andb2(ρ= 0.898). Moderate correlations are also evident between a11
andb1(ρ= 0.725), and between b1andb2(ρ= 0.759). When considering the govern-
ing equations of the biofilm growth given by eqs. (19) to (21), these correlations seem
reasonable as the respective parameters jointly influence the growth and degradation
behavior of the biofilm.
Figure 4 visualizes the model responses corresponding to the posterior samples,
alongside the data Dused for the updating. There, we show the responses for the
two individual quantities ϕandψas well as the combined measure ¯ϕ=ϕψ. It shall
be noted that the updating was only performed using the output ¯ϕand the corre-
sponding data. We visualize ϕandψalong with the respective data to validate the
calibrated model. In general, we observe a good agreement between the model outputs
and the data: the posterior-informed simulations can reproduce similar behavior as
the observed dataset while appropriately handling the variability introduced by ran-
dom realizations and differing termination times across trajectories. This holds true
# 15 for all measures, also for the two quantities used for the validations which highlights
the robustness of the parameter estimation.
The tight output prediction interval observed in fig. 4 is a contrast to fig. 5. There,
the model response ¯ϕwhen sampling the parameters θfrom the prior distributions
given in table 2 is visualized. It can be seen that the response for all possible parameters
from the prior covers a wide range of solutions.
Lastly, to show that using only the diagonal elements of the estimated covariance
matrix does not decrease the accuracy of the updating, fig. 6 shows the resulting p-
boxes. Figure 6a shows results with only the diagonal elements, while fig. 6b shows
results obtained from using the full covariance. Both results do not diverge from each
other, and the resulting intervals are very similar. Thus, in the following, we will
concentrate on only using the diagonal elements.

4.2 Case II: Four-Species Biofilm Model
As a second case study, we consider a biofilm model with n= 4 interacting species and
a total of 14 unknown parameters. To render Bayesian inference tractable, we employ
a hierarchical (multilevel) updating strategy in three stages. First, we decompose the
full four-species system into two simpler two-species submodels: M1captures the
interactions of species 1 and 2 (five parameters), and M2captures the interactions
of species 3 and 4 (five parameters). These submodels are calibrated in parallel using
uninformative priors, yielding posterior distributions on the reduced parameter spaces
D1
Θ⊂R5andD2
Θ⊂R5. A schematic of this multilevel updating is shown in fig. 7.
Next, in model M3, we assemble the full four-species interaction matrices A,B∈
R4×4, where the ten parameters already inferred in the submodels are highlighted
(blue for M1, red for M2). We now fix the corresponding ten parameters at their
respective maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimates obtained from Steps 1 and 2. As
a result, only the four remaining cross-block interaction parameters a13, a14, a23, a24
are treated as uncertain in M3and assigned uninformative uniform priors, yielding
# 18 a reduced inference subspace D3
Θ⊂R4. A final Bayesian update is then performed
solely over this four-dimensional subspace.

Fig. 7 : Visualization of the hierarchical updating procedure on two different levels:
Updating of two model M1andM2is performed using simpler two-species models,
subsequently M3is used to update the remaining interactions.
In practice, Steps 1 and 2 follow the same two-species Bayesian updating procedure
described in Case I, starting from uninformative priors. In Step 3, instead of reusing full
posterior distributions, we carry forward only the MAP estimates from M1andM2,
thereby focusing inference in M3entirely on the remaining four interaction param-
eters. This hierarchical structure reduces the dimensionality of each inference step—
from 14 parameters in total to two problems of dimension 5, followed by one of dimen-
sion 4. Such a staged reduction in dimensionality is expected to improve computational
efficiency and convergence, as also observed in [51], where the authors highlight the
impact of parameter dimension on the performance of TMCMC algorithms.
Afterwards, we look at a modified setup of M3to validate the calibrated param-
eters with new data in a different setup. For this, we apply the antibiotics only after
t= 0.5 to check if our calibrated are model parameters are robust to this change in
the setup. We denote this as the model M3
val. The selected simulation parameters of
the submodels are summarized in table 3. All prior distributions are chosen as U(0,3).
Values in table 3 vary between M1,M2andM3since the different species have dif-
ferent sensitivities to nutrients and antibiotics. In M2the antibiotics were reduced to
not have a zero-concentration of the bacteria, since this would lead to non-informative
data. Moreover, M2has a longer experimental duration (5000 instead of 2500 time
steps) due to slower growth of the microfilms. We simulated M1for a shorter dura-
tion because the concentrations became almost stationary and did not result in any
further information gain.
4.2.1 Interaction of Species 1 and 2
First, the parameter set θ(1)is inferred using the two-species model M1. For this
first submodel, the antibiotic parameter is set to α= 100m2
s2. We employ the same
likelihood and same approach as in case I for the updating. The resulting posterior
samples are shown in fig. 8. Here, again, for every parameter, a single peak along with
some spread aorund that can be observed. Notably, we observe a strong correlation
between the mean values of the parameters a11anda22.

response and the data can be observed.

4.2.2 Interaction of Species 3 and 4
The same approach is applied to infer the mean values of the parameter set θ(2)
with the second two-species model, M2. The results of the model calibration are
shown in figs. 10 and 11, which again show the posterior samples and model outputs,
respectively. Here, an antibiotic concentration of α= 10m2
s2is applied to build the
data set and perform the updating.
It can be observed that the peak are not as sharp as in the case of the first
parameter set. However, for all parameters but b4, the spread around the peak is still
small where comparing the ranges of the posterior samples to the prior range, i.e.,
[0,3]. Only for the antibiotic sensitivity of the forth species, b4, the range of posterior
samples is rather large.
The model output in fig. 11, however, shows very good agreement with the data
points that are used for the Bayesian updating of the second parameter set.

# 22 Fig. 11 : Comparison of the model output of model M2corresponding to calibrated

4.2.3 Remaining Interactions
After the first two parameter sets are inferred using the two submodels M1andM2,
the remaining interaction parameters can be determined with the final four-species
model M3. In this setup, we fix the parameters in θ(1)andθ(2)to their respective
MAP estimates. Thus, only the remaining four interactions parameters are inferred,
denotes as θ(3). Since the remaining interaction parameters are only in the matrix A,
the term that is not dependent on the antibiotic concentration, we set the latter to
α= 0.
The results of this third and last updating are show in figs. 12 and 13. Here, sharp
and distinct peaks along with a strong linear correlation can be observed for all four
parameters. Again, a good agreement between posterior model response and data is
observed after the updating.

4.2.4 Comparison of the identified posterior mean with true mean
In fig. 14, we compare the identified material parameters with the true parameter
values used for the data generation. In addition, an error bar is added to the posterior
means highlighting the standard deviation of the posterior. For almost all parameters,
the values are very similar. The largest difference is obtained for the parameter b4
connected to the sensitivity to antibiotics of the fourth biofilm. In addition, a rather
high standard deviation of the posterior results. This gives an important hint that
more data is needed for a better identification.
Fig. 14 : Comparison of the mean values of the identified parameters and true values
used to generate the data used in case II. The error bars reflect the standard deviation
of the posterior samples of the respective parameters.
4.2.5 Validation with time-dependent antibiotics
As a final part, a validation setup is considered in order to see how robust the calibrated
model parameters are to a changed setup. Specifically, a time-dependent application
of antibiotics is considered in the validation case. As indicated for M3
valin table 3,
antibiotics are applied t= 0.5. For t <0.5, the setup is identical with model M3used
to calibrate the final interaction parameters.
The result of the validation is shown in fig. 15. There, the model responses up until
the antibiotics are applied are the same in for M3. When the antibiotics are applied,
a rapid change of the antibiotic concentration can be observed. Again, we see a good
agreement between the data and the predicted model response. Here, the data is only
used to validate the predicted response by comparison; no additional model calibration
is performed. We note that the application of the antibiotics leads to an increased
variability in the model response for the same set of inputs. This validation also shows
that calibrating a physical model is useful in settings where the model is used in a
# 25 predictive setting. Since the underlying model parameters were updated, a change in
environmental conditions can be modeled, even if no data is available for this change.

valcorresponding to calibrated
posterior samples (shaded) and the data (scatter). The output for t <0.5 corresponds
toM3from fig. 13.
# 5 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a Bayesian updating approach for biofilm growth mod-
els that accounts for hybrid uncertainties, incorporating both epistemic (unknown
parameters) and aleatory (biological variability) uncertainty via a probabilistic for-
mulation. Traditional double-loop approaches to uncertainty quantification are often
inefficient in this context. To address this, we employed a reduced-order model based
on Time-separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM), enabling the propagation of aleatory
uncertainty with only a single model evaluation, thus eliminating the need for nested
simulation loops. By leveraging a Taylor-decomposition-based representation of the
stochastic process, our approach allows direct computation of the outputs mean
and variance, which are then used in a Gaussian likelihood function for inference.
This significantly reduces computational costs while preserving accuracy in capturing
uncertainty effects compared to a Monte Carlo approach.
The proposed methodology was validated through two representative case studies.
The first involves a two-species biofilm model with five parameters, where monolithic
updating was used to infer parameters governing growth, interaction, and antibiotic
sensitivity. The second expands to a four-species system with fourteen parameters,
employing a hierarchical inference strategy to decompose the high-dimensional prob-
lem into tractable sub-tasks. In both cases, the model successfully recovered the
# 26 true parameters and revealed meaningful interdependencies among them, highlight-
ing the ability of the method to capture complex inter-species dynamics. Additionally,
a validation study using time-dependent antibiotic application confirmed that the
inferred parameters retain predictive power under varying experimental conditions.
This supports the robustness and generalizability of the calibrated model.
Furthermore, our results show that employing the TSM-ROM approach for
Bayesian updating is robust to nonlinearities and suitable to deal with a large number
of uncertain parameters. Moreover, since the TSM-ROM directly captures the out-
put’s uncertainties, the necessity for expensive multi-query simulations is removed and
the updating is less demanding in terms of computation time. The proposed approach
therefore has the ability to reduce the time it takes to infer model parameters. Thus,
the TSM-ROM approach can be used to accelerate the verification of the presented
biofilm model against in vitro biofilm data, as for example presented by [52].
Overall, the TSM-ROM approach offers a computationally efficient and robust
framework for Bayesian inference in complex, uncertainty-laden biological systems. In
future research, the computational demand can further be addressed by using more
efficient updating schemes like variational inference [53] or more efficient sampling
strategies [54].
